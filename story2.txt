A Day at the Zoo

Today, I went to the zoo with my <relation>. We saw a(n) <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its tree. The <animal> <verb_past_tense> through the large tunnel that led to its <adjective2> <place>. I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray <animal2> towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a <adjective3> scoop of <food> from the zoo caf√©. Afterwards, we had to run to catch our <adjective4> <vehicle> home!
